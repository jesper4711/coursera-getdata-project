# Codebook course assignment for Getting and Cleaning data

The below is the full set of column variables for the cleaned data set. Columns 1-86 are extracted from the original dataset and represent activity in a set of subjects. Column 87 are activity labels and column 88 are subject labels. Rows consist of averaged variables over subjects and activity labels. Some cleaning of 
variable names were performed so that variables are always named according to convention:

myNewTidyVariableName

A few symbols were also cleaned from variable names:

"(", ")", "-" and ","

These are the variables (columns in data frame):
